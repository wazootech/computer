/**
 * The handoff-artifact tools.
 *
 * @remarks
 * A handoff artifact is a Markdown document one station produces and another reads, passed by id
 * so the text never travels through the orchestrator's context. Stations that produce long
 * documents hold the saver, stations that consume them hold the reader, and the orchestrator
 * holds only the reader, which is what keeps a relayed document out of the conversation.
 *
 * Key layout, id format, and bounds live in `config.ts`; this module is the tool interface over
 * it. Both tools are inert by construction (validated ids, no overwrite, bounded size), so they
 * are safe inside task-mode stations that cannot park on approval. Authorization resolves from
 * the ambient Vercel OIDC credentials.
 */

/**
 * Build the tool that saves a handoff artifact.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Long output that another station needs, but nobody wants pasted through the orchestrator, goes
 * here instead of into the structured output. The caller returns the id and a short summary, the
 * orchestrator relays the id into the next station's message, and the receiving station reads
 * it. The document itself never passes through the orchestrator's context.
 *
 * @returns The `save_artifact` tool definition.
