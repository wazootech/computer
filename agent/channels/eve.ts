/**
 * Dev-only: present a trusted local session as an authenticated user.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The user-preference tools key their storage on a `principalType: "user"` session. In
 * production the channels supply one; the eve dev TUI authenticates with `localDev()`,
 * whose `local-dev` principal is not a user, so user-scoped tool calls fail with
 * `principal_required`. This shim defers the trust decision to `localDev()` — returning `null`
 * for anything it would reject, so it never affects production — and only upgrades the resolved
 * principal to a user. Drop it if you don't exercise user-scoped tools from the dev TUI.
