/**
 * GitHub tool surface for the orchestrator, mounted as an eve extension.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - Tools appear to the model as `github__<name>`; credentials are brokered
 *   by Vercel Connect through {@link GITHUB_CONNECTOR}, resolved per call and
 *   never exposed to the model. `context` fills `owner`/`repo` from
 *   `FACTORY_REPO` so tool calls omit them.
 * - `include` is the allowlist; there is no preset. Reads, triage writes, and
 *   PR authoring are in; merge tools are deliberately absent (a person merges
 *   in the GitHub UI), and so are repo administration, gists (they 403 over
 *   Connect installation tokens), releases, and CI mutation.
 * - `requireApproval` doubles as the authorization policy
 *   (`agent/lib/github/approval.ts`): trusted callers run reversible writes
 *   without a card, unattended factory runs are denied everything except
 *   labels, progress comments on their own intake issue, closing or reopening
 *   issues, and draft pull requests (a card would strand them). Closing an
 *   issue is reversible triage, so it runs for every caller; only shipping
 *   (marking a non-draft or ready-for-review PR) parks for a person no matter
 *   who asks. Write tools not listed here would keep the SDK's
 *   approval-by-default.
