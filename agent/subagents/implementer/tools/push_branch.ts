/**
 * Pushes a committed feature branch of the sandbox checkout to the factory
 * repository.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The push is inert by construction, which is why it runs without approval
 * inside a task-mode station: `validateBranch` refuses `main`, `master`, and
 * anything that isn't a plain branch name, so nothing this tool does can
 * change the default branch or merge. The credential is brokered at the
 * sandbox firewall and never enters the sandbox, and the push targets
 * {@link REMOTE_URL} literally, never the model-writable `origin` remote. The
 * `finally` block drops the brokered credential again.
