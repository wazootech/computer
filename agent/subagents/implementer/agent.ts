/**
 * Station 3: implementation.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Executes the analyst's plan in its own checkout of the factory repository,
 * verifies the work with the repository's own checks, commits on a feature
 * branch, and pushes it with the `push_branch` tool. The push is the
 * station's only side effect and it is inert by construction: feature
 * branches only (main and master are refused in code), the credential is
 * brokered at the sandbox firewall, and a branch alone can't merge. The pull
 * request is opened later by the orchestrator, after review.
