/**
 * Station 2: analysis and planning.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Works from a live checkout of the factory repository (this station's
 * sandbox clones it at template build), so the plan names real files and the
 * repository's actual conventions instead of guesses. It plans; it never
 * writes the implementation. The acceptance criteria it produces are the
 * contract the reviewer later judges the implementation against, verbatim.
