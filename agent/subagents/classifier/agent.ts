/**
 * Station 1: triage.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Runs on a fast, cheap model because classification is a shaping step, not
 * an analysis step. The station receives only text (the work item plus any
 * thread context the orchestrator packs into `message`) and returns the
 * structured classification the rest of the pipeline routes on.
 * `needs_clarification` is the pipeline's stop signal; the orchestrator asks
 * the human instead of proceeding on guesses.
