 * @remarks
 * Declared subagents share nothing with the root or each other, so the
 * reviewer gets its own checkout from the shared builders in
 * `agent/lib/github/repo-sandbox.ts` and fetches the branch under review
 * itself with `checkout_branch`. Reviewing in a separate sandbox from the
 * implementer is deliberate: the reviewer sees the pushed branch, not the
 * implementer's working state.
