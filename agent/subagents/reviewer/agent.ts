/**
 * Station 4: independent review.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Runs on a different model vendor than the implementer on purpose: fresh
 * eyes are the station's point, and a different model doesn't share the
 * implementer's idiom or blind spots. It fetches the pushed branch into its
 * own checkout and judges the real diff against the analyst's acceptance
 * criteria; it never modifies code. Its verdict routes the pipeline: approve
 * ships a draft PR, request_changes loops back to the implementer (at most
 * twice), reject stops the line.
