/**
 * Fresh-context web-research subagent.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The root delegates here when a task needs an outside fact: a statistic, a competitor detail,
 * a primary-source link, or a claim to verify. The researcher runs in a fresh child session and
 * inherits none of the root's skills, connections, or tools — only the framework default harness,
 * whose `web_search` and `web_fetch` cover web research with no extra wiring. It works solely
 * from what the root packs into `message` plus what it fetches, so every claim must be grounded
 * in a real source: the root weaves in only cited `findings` and surfaces `gaps` to the user.
 *
 * `description` is what the root reads to decide when to delegate; `outputSchema` makes the
 * findings a structured, cited result it can act on directly.
 *
 * @see The research methodology and output contract in this folder's `instructions.md`.
